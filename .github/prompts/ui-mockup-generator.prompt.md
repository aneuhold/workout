Please take the attached overview of the workout system as a whole, and the attached workout ui document outlining some very simple UI requirements, and whip up a UI that you think would work well for the system overall. Feel free to add routes, and new shadcn components as described in the copilot instructions. Don't worry about organizing the overall chunks of the UI into appropriate components for now though. I want you to just wing it and feel free to be creative here. Your starting point is `src/routes/+page.svelte`. You have a blank canvas besides the UI requirements outlined in the document.
