description: Generate a UI mockup for the workout system based on the provided requirements and overview.

#file:../../docs/workout-ui.md
#file:../../docs/system-model.md

Please take the attached overview of the workout system as a whole, and the attached workout ui document outlining some very simple UI requirements, and whip up a UI that you think would work well for the system overall. Feel free to add routes, and new shadcn components as described in the copilot instructions (using the sub-agent for each new component). Don't worry about organizing the overall chunks of the UI into appropriate components for now though. I want you to just wing it and feel free to be creative here. Your starting point is `src/routes/+page.svelte`. You have a blank canvas besides the UI requirements outlined in the document. The output is expected to be a full UI mockup for the workout system with routes built out, no extra components in the components folder, besides those built by the sub-agent that you ask it to add from shadcn-svelte, and potentially layout files if you think they will help.

Feel free to ask questions using the `askQuestions` tool if you need any clarification on the requirements, system as a whole, or functional UI directions you aren't sure of.
